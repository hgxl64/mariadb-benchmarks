To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MySQL root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

  /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'new-password'
  /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43/bin/mysqladmin -u root -h cheetah02 password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:

  /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43/bin/mysql_secure_installation

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the manual for more instructions.

You can start the MySQL daemon with:

  cd /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43 ; /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43/bin/mysqld_safe &

You can test the MySQL daemon with mysql-test-run.pl

  cd mysql-test ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

WARNING: Found existing config file /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43/my.cnf on the system.
Because this file might be in use, it was not replaced,
but was used in bootstrap (unless you used --defaults-file)
and when you later start the server.
The new default config file was created as /home/axel/mariadb-install/mysql-5.6.43/my-new.cnf,
please compare it with your file and take the changes you need.

WARNING: Default config file /etc/mysql/my.cnf exists on the system
This file will be read by default by the MySQL server
If you do not want to use this, either remove it, or use the
--defaults-file argument to mysqld_safe when starting the server
