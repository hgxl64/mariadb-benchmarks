testing SEQUENCE objects

sequence.lua - use a table and atomic UPDATE + LAST_INSERT_ID() to emulate a sequence
sequence_native.lua - use a native sequence object

each iteration of the test draws a new number from the sequence (threads competing)
and then inserts a row using the sequence number as PK
