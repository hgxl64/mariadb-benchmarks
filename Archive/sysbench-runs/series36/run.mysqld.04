To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy
support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system

PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER !
To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands:

'/home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion/bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password'
'/home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion/bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h pitbull.askmonty.org password 'new-password'

Alternatively you can run:
'/home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion/bin/mysql_secure_installation'

which will also give you the option of removing the test
databases and anonymous user created by default.  This is
strongly recommended for production servers.

See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://kb.askmonty.org or the
MySQL manual for more instructions.

You can start the MariaDB daemon with:
cd '/home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion' ; /home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir='/mnt/fiox/sysbench/datadir'

You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl
cd '/home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion/mysql-test' ; perl mysql-test-run.pl

Please report any problems with the '/home/axel/mysql-builds/mariadb-5.5-fusion/scripts/mysqlbug' script!
