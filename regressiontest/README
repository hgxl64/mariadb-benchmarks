Prequisites
-----------

1. sysbench 1.0.20 or later

The provided Lua scripts (in subfolder lua) have been tested to work
with sybench 1.0.20 and sysbench 1.1.x. Better is a build of sysbench
from the GIT repository https://github.com/hgxl64/sysbench-1.x-mariadb.
With this fork of sysbench the latency fields 25%, 50% and 75% become
available and the histograms show more data.


2. numactl

numactl is used to restrict sysbench and the database server to certain
cpu cores.


3. iostat

iostat is used for monitoring cpu usage and IO statistics.


4. dstat

The dstat tool is used to monitor the client side, when doing benchmarks
over the network (branch remote-regressiontest).


5. gnuplot, perl

Gnuplot is used to create time series plots in the postprocessing step.
Perl is used to extract timeseries data.


6. git, cmake, C/C++ compiler etc

Those tools are required only when MariaDB/MySQL is to be built from
source GIT repositories.


7. perf, https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph

Those tools are optionally used collect profiles during the benchmark
and create flame graphs.


8. HammerDB 5.0 or higher

This tool is needed to run test t_tprocc. Install to a location that
fits you and set this is the host config file. I.e.

 config_variable HAMMERDB /opt/HammerDB-5.0


9. pstate-frequency

If your machine uses an Intel processor with the pstate cpu governor
then this package provides a method to run the benchmarks at fixed cpu
speed. Check out https://github.com/pyamsoft/pstate-frequency.git,
install it and then modify /etc/pstate-frequency.d/04-max.plan to have

PLAN_CPU_TURBO=off

in it. The benchmarks will be run using plan 'max' and swith back to
plan 'balanced' afterwards.


Invocation
----------

First you have to modify your environment. The easiest way to do this is:

cd .../regressiontest
. profile

Now .../regressiontest/bin is in your PATH and you can run any script.
The main scripts are those to run the regression test suite:

run_community_git.sh ........ on MariaDB community server, built locally
run_enterprise_git.sh ....... on MariaDB enterprise server, built locally
run_enterprise_jenkins.sh ... on MariaDB enterprise server, Jenkins build
run_installed.sh ............ on a server that is listening on localhost

In addition there are some helper scripts:

loop_community.sh
loop_enterprise.sh
  run community / enterprise server tests in an endless loop (using run_* scripts)

rt_functions.sh
  shell functions used by the other scripts

install_server.sh
  install a certain server version and build it if needed

build_community_from_git.sh
build_enterprise_from_git.sh
  build scripts for MariaDB community / enterprise server

run_postprocess.sh
  scripts run after a regression test to summarize results, produce
  time series plots, etc. WIP

dump_perf.sh
dump_pfs.sh
dump_status.sh
  scripts used by individual tests to collect additional metrics

All scripts take parameters. Invoke with --help to get a list.


Output files
------------

The run_* scripts produce a lot of output. Each invocation of those scripts
creates a directory in $RT_LOG_HOME. The name of that directory is
<timestamp>.<job name>.<branch tested>.<commit tested>

The branch / commit parts may be missing. The job name is "regressiontest"
followed by the product (i.e. "mariadb-enterprise"). The timestamp is human
readable and contains date (YYYYMMDD) and time (HHMMSS).

All output from the scripts goes into various files (documented elsewhere)
in that directory. Any executed test case (aka benchmark) creates its own
subdirectory with a name corresponding to the test name and writes there.


Configuration
-------------

Configuration is read from .../regressiontest/config/ and is done by setting
environment variables. There are 3 files that are mandatory:

global ............... configuration for any invocation of run_* scripts
mariadb-community .... configuration specific for MariaDB community server
mariadb-enterprise ... configuration specific for MariaDB enterprise server

One optional but important config file is named like the host ($HOSTNAME).
It contains settings that are specific for running regression tests there.

Environment variables set in conf files should use the "config_variable"
function defined in rt_functions.sh. That allows to set those environment
variables manually and override the defaults.


Environment variables
---------------------

The following list contains all environment variables used by one or the
other script:

ASYNCSQL
  SQL statements run asynchronously after starting the server
  example ASYNCSQL="BACKUP STAGE START; DO SLEEP(7200);"

CPU_MASK_MYSQLD
  which cpu cores the server process should be restricted to
  this is passed to 'numactl'. Example: "--physcpubind=0-7"
  default is all cpu cores

CPU_MASK_SYSBENCH
  which cpu cores anything except the server should be restricted to
  this is passed to 'numactl'. Example: "--physcpubind=8-11"
  default is all cpu cores

DATADIR
  the directory holding the data dir of the MariaDB server under test
  that directory is removed and created if needed, so the parent must
  be writable by the user running the tests. No default

DATADISK
  the name of the disk device that holds the → DATADIR. Default: none,
  that also disables the time series plots for disk IO

DUMP_PERF
  boolean switch to enable (1) or disable (anything else) collecting
  'perf' profiles during test execution. Default: disabled

DUMP_PFS
  boolean switch to enable (1) or disable (anything else) collecting
  performance schema dumps during test execution. Default: disabled

DUMP_STATUS
  boolean switch to enable (1) or disable (anything else) collecting
  GLOBAL STATUS variables during test execution. Default: disabled

EXTRAMYCNF
  extra server options passed as command line parameters when a server
  is started. Example: "--innodb-adaptive-hash-index=on"

FLAMEGRAPH
  location of local clone of https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph

  the git repository for the server to test
  Example: "https://github.com/MariaDB/server.git"

INSTALLDIR
  the directory where server binaries should be put. There will be a
  subdirectory <product>-<branch>-<commit> created for each one.

JENKINS_ARCH
  the architecture of the Jenkins build used for testing.
  Example: "Linux-x86_64". No default

JENKINS_OS

  Example: "ubuntu-2404". No default

JENKINS_URL
  the base URL for Jenkins builds. No default

LOCAL_GIT_REPO
  where the → GIT_REPO is cloned locally. No default

MYSQL_INSTALL_DB
  the name of the MySQL/MariaDB installion helper tool

MYSQLD
  the name of the MySQL/MariaDB server binary

MYSQLD_SAFE
  the name of the MySQL/MariaDB server wrapper

NBUILD
  the number of concurrent processes used by make (option -j)
  default: use 'make -j' with no value

NCPU
  the number of cpu cores available for the server
  Default: number of installed cores

PROFILETIME
  the time in seconds for which to run 'perf record'
  used only when → DUMP_PERF is 1

  used only when → DUMP_PERF is 1

RUN_FSTRIM
