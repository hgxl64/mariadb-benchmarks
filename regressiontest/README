Prequisites
-----------

1. sysbench 1.0.20 or later

The provided Lua scripts (in subfolder lua) have been tested to work
with sybench 1.0.20 and sysbench 1.1.x. Better is a build of sysbench
from the GIT repository https://github.com/hgxl64/sysbench-1.x-mariadb.
With this fork of sysbench the latency fields 25%, 50% and 75% become
available and the histograms show more data.


2. numactl

numactl is used to restrict sysbench and the database server to certain
cpu cores.


3. iostat

iostat is used for monitoring cpu usage and IO statistics.


3. dstat

The dstat tool is used to monitor the client side, when doing benchmarks
over the network (branch remote-regressiontest).


5. git, cmake, C/C++ compiler

Those tools are required only when MariaDB/MySQL is to be built from
source GIT repositories.
